        <h3 class="white-text center">BROWNIES</h3>
        <br> <img src="BROWNIE.jpg" class="img">
<h5 class="white-text"> INGREDIENTS:</h5>
<br>
<li type = "square"> 100 g. of butter </li>
<li> 200 g. of dark chocolate 70% minimum (the brand you like the most) </li>
<li> 4 large eggs </li>
<li> 100 g of normal or icing sugar </li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon (dessert type) of baking soda. </li>
<li> 1 tablespoon of vanilla essence </li>
<li> 80 g of wheat flour </li>
<li> Of 50 g. to 100 g. of nuts (depends on what you like) </li>
<br>

<h5 class="center ">PREPARATION:</h5>
     <p>

<br>The first thing is to prepare the container where we are going to cook them. I used a tray of 20 x 20cm glass and baking paper.<br>
<br>The measure of the tray gives for 9 generous brownies, but everything depends on how we want it to be thick. If you want them smaller, use a larger tray.<br>
<br>We cover the tray and spread it with butter. Sprinkle the oven paper with chocolate powder. I have not used flour because the last time I prepared it, there were small specks of white flour in the base. <br>
<br>With this trick we solve this problem and on top we give more chocolate flavor to this cake. <br>
<br>We put in a bowl the grated chocolate or in small pieces with butter and put it in the microwave for 4 minutes at medium temperature. We take out and mix the mixture well with a stick until it is a cream similar to chocolate cream. <br>
<br>Beat the eggs with the sugar in a large bowl until there is a foamy cream. Add the tablespoon of vanilla and baking soda. Pour the chocolate cream in the previous bowl and mix well with the rods. <br>
<br> We sieve the flour with a sieve and add to the previous mixture. We stir very well until we obtain a homogeneous cream paste.<br>
<br> We cut the nuts into pieces and passed them through a little chocolate powder. We put them in the cream and with a fork we cover them well with the chocolate.<br>
<br>We bake the brownie in the preheated oven at 180º C in the middle part for 35-40 minutes with the hot oven up and down (without air).<br>
<br>As I mentioned in some other recipe, it all depends on the oven, always look with a fork that comes out dry when pricked.<br>
<br>When it has been 20 minutes in the oven, cover with a little aluminum foil so that the surface does not burn and the crust is perfect and crunchy.<br>
<br> In my oven, the preparation time is exactly 40 minutes, but in my mother's 30-35 minutes it arrives. You do not have to go through time because you will get some dry cakes that nobody can eat them. <br>
<br> We let it cool on the tray and when it is cold we cut it into several portions. We separate them from the oven paper and present them on a plate with a bit of vanilla or chocolate ice cream, or with hot chocolate. For the most demanding chocolate palates.<br>

<h5 class="white-text"> INGREDIENTS:</h5>
<br>
<li type = "square"> 1 1/4 cup of piloncillo </li>
<li> 1 1/2 cup of water </li>
<li> 1 cinnamon stick </li>
<li> 1/4 cup of raisins </li>
<li> 3 tablespoons of melted butter </li>
<li> 3/4 cup Cotija cheese </li>
<li> 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil </li>
<li> 1/4 cup of raisins </li>
<li> 16 slices of bread roll 1/3 inch at least two days before </li>
<li> 1/4 cup of peanuts </li>
<li> 2 tablespoons of butter in cubes </li>



<h5 class="center ">PREPARATION:</h5>
     <p>

<br>Preheat the oven to 350oF (180oC).<br>
<br>In a medium saucepan heat the piloncillo, cinnamon, cloves and water at medium temperature so that the piloncillo melts to form a syrup.
<br>Mix the butter - previously melted - with the oil and varnish with this mixture the slices of bread. Place the slices of bread in a tray and put them in the oven for 8 minutes. Then turn the slices of bread so that they have a golden brown and leave them approx. 5 more minutes until they are a light golden color.<br>
<br>Now follows the process of assembling the capirotada: Start placing the slices of bread on the base of a baking dish and cover each of these with the brown sugar syrup. (Make sure each slice is well soaked in this syrup). If you prefer soak the bread in the syrup first and then put it in the mold.<br>
<br>Cover this first layer of bread with cheese, raisins, peanuts and any other fruit or nuts that you have decided to add.<br>
<br>Place another layer of bread and continue with the same process as in the previous step.<br>
<br>When you have finished with all the layers, empty the rest of the syrup; cover them with cheese, raisins and peanuts, and place the butter cubes on top. Cover the mold with aluminum foil and bake for about 45 minutes. until all layers of bread are moistened and a golden layer has formed.<br>

<li> 2 dessert spoons of Baking powder. </li>
<li> ½ teaspoon of salt. </li>
<li> ½ cup of Sugar (100 grams) </li>
<li> 2 Eggs. </li>
<li> 1 tablespoon of Butter. </li>



<h5 class="center ">PREPARATION:</h5>
     <p>

<br>Making muffins at home is very simple, you just need to gather the right ingredients and the right utensils, like a big bowl, cupcake molds, electric or manual rods and a colander. That said, we started beating the butter at room temperature with the sugar.<br>
<br>Then, to get the easy-to-make homemade muffins to be fluffy, we separated the white from the yolks of the eggs. We introduce the yolks to the previous mixture and continue beating.<br>
<br>Then pour the milk and continue mixing to integrate all the ingredients. We sieve the flour with the baking powder and salt, add this mixture and incorporate it with a spatula, making enveloping movements. Besides, we preheat the oven to 200 ºC.<br>
<br>To enhance the flavor of homemade muffins, you can add vanilla essence, lemon juice or cinnamon powder. Once the dough is ready, we take 3/4 of the molds and bake for 20-30 minutes at 180 ºC with heat up and down. Depending on the furnace it may take less time to be done, so it is important to monitor them.<br>
<br>We puncture one with a toothpick and if it comes out completely clean it will mean that the homemade muffins are already there and we can remove them from the oven. Let them cool on a rack before serving. Once cold, we can decorate them with icing sugar, chocolate sauce, caramel, dulce de leche, or what we like the most! As you can see, these are easy-to-make, quick and delicious muffins.<br>
