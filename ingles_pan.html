 <br>Place the butter on the dough, cover the butter with the dough and start to stretch along.<br> Fold as if it were a triptych, stretch again and fold 3 more times. Let rest for 30 more minutes
STRET the dough again and cut it lengthwise; you must obtain 10 cm wide strips. Make diagonal cuts to obtain triangles. Stretch the dough gently and roll the triangles from the widest part to the narrowest, to get the shape of the little horn.<br>
 <br>Leave them like this to obtain croissants or lower the ends for the little horns.
